# Testing Vertex AI Session Sidebar Integration

## What Changed
We've updated the chat sidebar to fetch and display sessions from Vertex AI instead of Supabase, completing the full transition to Vertex AI as the single source of truth.

### Changes Made:
1. **`nextjs/src/hooks/useSession.ts`**
   - Replaced `supabaseSessionService.loadUserSessions()` with `fetchActiveSessionsAction()`
   - Updated session data structure to include message counts
   - Changed source indicator from 'supabase' to 'vertex-ai'

2. **`nextjs/src/components/chat/DesktopSidebar.tsx`**
   - Added message count display next to each session
   - Enhanced session information display

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
# Commit the sidebar integration changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Complete Vertex AI sidebar integration - display sessions from Agent Engine"

# Push to your repository
git push origin dev

# Vercel should auto-deploy, or manually trigger deployment
```

### 2. Test Sidebar Session Display

#### Step A: Verify Session Loading Source
1. Open your Vercel app: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
2. Login with OAuth
3. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
4. Refresh the page and look for console messages

**Expected Messages:**
- `üîÑ [useSession] Loading sessions from Vertex AI (Agent Engine)...`
- `üìä [useSession] Vertex AI load result: { success: true, dataLength: X }`
- `‚úÖ [useSession] Loaded X sessions from Vertex AI`

**Should NOT see:**
- Any messages about "Loading sessions from Supabase"
- Any Supabase-related session loading

#### Step B: Check Session Display Format
In the sidebar, sessions should now show:
- **Source badge**: "vertex-ai" (instead of "supabase")
- **Message count**: "X msgs" next to each session
- **Last activity**: Date of last session activity

#### Step C: Test Network Calls
1. Open Developer Tools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Filter by "sessions"

**Expected Network Calls:**
- Calls to your Agent Engine endpoint for session listing
- NO calls to Supabase session tables

### 3. Test Session Persistence and Interaction

#### Step A: Create New Session
1. Click "New Chat" button in sidebar
2. Start a conversation: "Hello, this is a test session"
3. Send a few more messages
4. Check if session appears immediately in sidebar with:
   - "vertex-ai" source badge
   - Correct message count (should match messages sent)

#### Step B: Test Session Switching
1. Click on an existing session in the sidebar
2. Verify the conversation history loads correctly
3. The session should become highlighted as active
4. All previous messages should appear

#### Step C: Test Session Persistence
1. Refresh the browser page
2. All sessions should still be visible in sidebar
3. Active session should remain selected
4. Session order should be maintained (most recent first)

### 4. Test Cross-Deployment Persistence

#### Step A: Create Test Session
1. Create a new conversation
2. Send message: "Remember: my test deployment session"
3. Note the session in the sidebar

#### Step B: Make Minor Deployment
1. Make a tiny change (update a UI text)
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Wait for deployment to complete

#### Step C: Verify Session Survives
1. Open the app after deployment
2. The test session should still be visible in sidebar
3. Click the session to load it
4. The conversation should be intact

### 5. Verify Console Logs

Check the browser console for these key indicators:

**‚úÖ Success Indicators:**
```
üîÑ [useSession] Loading sessions from Vertex AI (Agent Engine)...
üìä [useSession] Vertex AI load result: { success: true, dataLength: 2 }
üìö [useSession] Processed Vertex AI sessions: [{...}]
‚úÖ [useSession] Loaded 2 sessions from Vertex AI
```

**‚ùå Failure Indicators (These Should NOT Appear):**
```
Loading sessions from Supabase...
Supabase load result...
Failed to load session history: [Supabase error]
```

### 6. Visual Verification Checklist

In the sidebar, each session should display:
- [ ] Session title (auto-generated or custom)
- [ ] "vertex-ai" source badge (blue/gray background)
- [ ] Message count: "X msg" or "X msgs"
- [ ] Last activity date
- [ ] Proper highlighting when selected

### 7. Troubleshooting

#### Issue: No Sessions Appear
**Check:**
- Console for Vertex AI loading messages
- Network tab for session API calls
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Verify `AGENT_ENGINE_ID` is set in environment

#### Issue: Sessions Show as "supabase" Source
**Fix:** Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

#### Issue: Message Counts Wrong
**Note:** This is expected initially - message counts update as you interact with sessions

#### Issue: Session Loading Fails
**Check:**
- Agent Engine is deployed and accessible
- Service account authentication is working
- Environment variables are correct

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Sidebar loads sessions from Vertex AI (not Supabase)
- [ ] Sessions display with "vertex-ai" source badge
- [ ] Message counts appear next to sessions
- [ ] Clicking sessions loads conversation history
- [ ] New sessions appear immediately in sidebar
- [ ] Sessions persist across page refreshes
- [ ] Sessions persist across deployments
- [ ] No Supabase session queries in network tab

## Expected Behavior Changes

### ‚úÖ What Now Works Better:
- Sessions are truly persistent across deployments
- Single source of truth (no sync issues)
- Real message counts from actual conversations
- Consistent session data between backend and frontend

### üìù What You Might Notice:
- Session titles may be different (auto-generated from Vertex AI)
- Message counts start from 0 and build up
- Old Supabase sessions won't appear (this is expected)

## Next Steps After Successful Testing

1. **Monitor Performance**: Check if session loading is fast enough
2. **User Feedback**: Verify the session display meets user needs
3. **Cleanup**: Consider removing unused Supabase session code
4. **Merge to Main**: Once testing is successful, merge changes to production

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. The previous Supabase loading code is still in place (just unused)
2. Can quickly revert the import changes in `useSession.ts`
3. Implement feature flag to switch between implementations if needed

**üéØ This completes the full transition to Vertex AI sessions!** Your chat sidebar now displays sessions directly from your Agent Engine's Vertex AI session service, providing a consistent and persistent user experience.
