# Rollback from Vertex AI Session State Implementation

**Date:** 2025-08-20  
**Time:** Morning  
**Branch:** Rolled back from `adk-dev` to `dev`  

## Summary

We attempted to implement Vertex AI session state management from the `adk-dev` branch but encountered issues that required rolling back to the stable `dev` branch.

## What Was Attempted

- Implementation of Vertex AI session state management
- Integration from the `adk-dev` branch
- Session persistence using Vertex AI's native capabilities

## Reason for Rollback

The Vertex AI session state implementation from the `adk-dev` branch introduced complexity and potential instability that wasn't suitable for the current development phase.

## Current State

- **Active Branch:** `dev`
- **Status:** Stable
- **Next Steps:** Continue development on the `dev` branch with the existing architecture

## Lessons Learned

1. The Vertex AI session state management requires more thorough testing before integration
2. The `adk-dev` branch features may be too experimental for production readiness
3. Maintaining stability on the `dev` branch is prioritized over advanced features at this stage

## Action Items

- [ ] Document the specific issues encountered with Vertex AI session state
- [ ] Create a separate testing environment for experimental features
- [ ] Continue development on stable foundation
- [ ] Revisit Vertex AI session state after core functionality is complete

---

*This rollback ensures we maintain a stable development environment while we continue building core features.*
