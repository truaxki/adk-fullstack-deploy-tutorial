## Log Entries

### Entry 1: Rollback from adk-dev Branch
**Time**: Morning  
**Action**: Rolled back from `adk-dev` branch to `dev` branch  
**Reason**: Issues with Vertex AI session state implementation  
**Details**:
- The `adk-dev` branch was attempting to use Vertex AI session state functionality
- Implementation encountered compatibility or functionality issues
- Decision made to revert to the stable `dev` branch
- All Vertex AI session state changes have been temporarily shelved

**Impact**:
- Returned to previous stable state
- Need to reassess Vertex AI integration approach
- May need to refactor session management strategy

**Next Steps**:
- Document the specific issues encountered with Vertex AI session state
- Evaluate alternative approaches for session management
- Plan incremental implementation strategy
