## 🚧 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Edge Runtime Warnings
**Status**: Non-blocking
**Description**: Supabase client uses Node.js APIs not available in Edge Runtime
**Solution**: Use Node.js runtime for API routes (already configured)

### Issue 2: Build Cache on Windows
**Status**: Resolved
**Description**: Windows build cache can cause false positives
**Solution**: Clean build before deployment
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm run build
```

## 📚 Key Learnings

1. **TypeScript Strictness**: Production builds enforce much stricter rules than development
2. **Dual Architecture**: Separating auth (Supabase) from business logic (ADK) provides better scalability
3. **Star Schema**: Central user table with radiating relationships simplifies RLS policies
4. **SSE Patterns**: Understanding streaming termination signals is crucial for proper message capture
5. **Systematic Debugging**: Each fix reveals the next issue - patience and documentation are key
